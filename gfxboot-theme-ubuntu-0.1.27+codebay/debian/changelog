gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.26) dapper-updates; urgency=low

  * Rename identifier for "Install in text mode" from txt_menuitem_install
    to txt_menuitem_install_text, to avoid clashing with "Install to the
    hard disk" (closes: Malone #47615).
  * Make "lang" file work with locales that require _CC (pt_BR, zh_CN,
    zh_TW).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 18 Jul 2006 14:33:15 +0100

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.25) dapper; urgency=low

  * "Install to first hard disk" -> "Install to the hard disk". Whoops.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 26 May 2006 14:38:02 +0100

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.24) dapper; urgency=low

  * Restore old "Install to first hard disk" string alongside "Install in
    text mode", so that it can be used for Edubuntu and the Ubuntu server
    CDs.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 26 May 2006 14:16:28 +0100

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.23) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix check for whether we're running on a live CD.
  * Drop "Motor Difficulties - pointing devices" from the accessibility
    menu, as gok doesn't work on the Dapper live CD (Henrik Nilsen Omma).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 22 May 2006 17:08:40 +0100

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.22) dapper; urgency=low

  * Update boot menu label text (Matt Zimmerman, Jane Silber):
    - "Start (Ubuntu|Kubuntu|Edubuntu|Xubuntu)" -> "Start or install
      (Ubuntu|Kubuntu|Edubuntu|Xubuntu)".
    - "Install to first hard disk" -> "Install in text mode".
    Although it's a bit evil, I've unfuzzied all translations, on the basis
    that the existing translations are better than no translations.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 22 May 2006 12:40:44 +0100

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.21) dapper; urgency=low

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.19) dapper; urgency=low

    default background).

    Bokmål, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Romanian, Russian,

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.17) dapper; urgency=low

  * Update Portuguese translation (thanks, Rui Azevedo).
  * Interpret gfxboot-foreground and gfxboot-background keywords in the
    isolinux configuration file, using them to control the menu item colours
    (closes: Malone #31847).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon,  6 Mar 2006 13:36:13 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.16) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add localisation for the boot menu items currently added by the Ubuntu
    debian-cd branch.
  * Handle ^ in boot menu item labels a bit later to accommodate
    localisation.
  * Update Portuguese translation (thanks, Rui Azevedo).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 28 Feb 2006 08:34:17 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.15) dapper; urgency=low

    causing offence.
  * Drop "Motor Difficulties - switch devices" and "Everything" from the

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 22 Feb 2006 23:33:42 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.14) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add the keymap menu to the short panel too, and move it to F3 next to
    language.
  * Update locale-to-keymap mappings from console-keymaps-at
    2002.12.04dbs-52.1ubuntu3.
  * Don't map keys that are special when unshifted; this caused problems for
    the French keymap, and made it difficult in general to get out of a
    keymap you selected by accident (closes: Malone #31767).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 22 Feb 2006 10:40:36 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.13) dapper; urgency=low

  * pa is Punjabi (Gurmukhi), not Persian.
  * Update language names from localechooser 0.27ubuntu4, adding Kazakh.
  * Fix encoding of Galician translation.
  * Update font to add characters necessary for Kazakh ("Қазақ").
  * Pass debian-installer/locale=pt_PT rather than just pt for Portuguese,
    allowing localechooser to do a better job of handling the preseeding
    (part of Malone #31477).
  * Teach setkeymap to try looking for a keymap based just on the language
    code in case it can't find it based on ll_CC.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 16 Feb 2006 13:39:41 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.12) dapper; urgency=low

  * Switch selected and deselected colours in boot option menu, since blue
    is a better deselected/background colour (thanks, Paul Sladen).
  * Enlarge help window.
  * Adjust help keybindings to make more sense with our help screens.
  * Open the first help page if the context doesn't match anything.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue,  7 Feb 2006 16:50:48 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.11) dapper; urgency=low

  * Disable transparent menus: they make it too difficult for visually
    impaired users to read the menu labels.
  * Reduce the width of the keymap menu a bit by removing some unnecessary
    text from the German option.
  * Try to ensure that menus don't overflow the right-hand edge of the
    screen, even when their panel entry is placed quite far to the right.
  * Add an accessibility menu, per
    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuExpress/Accessibility.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  1 Feb 2006 19:38:05 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.8) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rename languages to langlist to avoid running into 8.3 file name
    restrictions on ISO9660.
  * Remove langlist from the bootlogo file and just include it on the file
    system.
  * Add a keymap menu.
  * Allow mapping multiple locales to a single keymap.
  * Update keymaps and locale-to-keymap mappings from console-keymaps-at
    2002.12.04dbs-50ubuntu2.

    as kbd-chooser/method=%s.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 14:17:58 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.7) dapper; urgency=low

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.6) dapper; urgency=low

  * Remove timeout clock graphics, which seem to break on some machines and
    were scary-looking anyway (closes: Ubuntu #21210).
  * Add Galician translation (thanks, Pedro Silva; closes: Ubuntu #21806).
  * Consider bit depth while sorting video modes.
  * Remove duplicates from video mode list (closes: Ubuntu #21578).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 11 Jan 2006 12:32:46 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.5) dapper; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Stop trying to install *.dat.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 21 Dec 2005 16:23:37 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.4) dapper; urgency=low

  * Remove kroete.dat idle animation, which doesn't fit with the Ubuntu
    theme.
  * Show colour bit depth of each mode in VGA menu.
  * Include video modes with at least 16-bit colour, not just exactly 16-bit
    colour.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 19 Dec 2005 18:40:12 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.3) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add live CD test function (looks for /casper/filesystem.cloop).
  * Offer normal/expert mode panel option on media other than live CDs.
  * Swap round "VGA" and "Other Options" panel entries.
  * Restore the short and full panel modes, the latter accessed using "Other
    Options"; put the normal/expert mode choice only in the full mode.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 19 Dec 2005 10:41:38 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.2) dapper; urgency=low

  * Don't add "64" to the end of certain kernel names when booting on amd64.
  * Remove obsolete alternate kernel feature.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 14 Dec 2005 10:47:48 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Make this Architecture: amd64 i386 rather than all, since it depends on
    gfxboot which is only supported on those architectures.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 12 Dec 2005 16:44:06 +0000

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.0) dapper; urgency=low

  * Initial release, based on the SuSE theme in gfxboot 3.2.5. Notable
    changes in this theme versus SuSE:
    - Remove "Christmas penguins" theme.
    - Remove driver update disk feature.
    - Remove boot loader splash; usplash should be able to provide
      everything we need along these lines.
    - Remove SuSE-specific images and sounds.
    - Drop back to just 640x480 modes (with a last-resort fallback to
      640x400x4), at least for now.
    - Use "splash.pcx" in the syslinux configuration directory as the
      background image if we find it. We'll use this for alternate
      Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Edubuntu branding.
    - Interpret a subset of the syslinux simple menu configuration syntax in
      the isolinux configuration file to allow hiding menu items and setting
      human-readable labels.
    - Remove all help texts (which were SuSE-specific anyway); the intent is
      for this to be a generic theme and to put help texts elsewhere,
      probably in debian-installer. Disable the help panel item if no help
      texts are available.
    - Various visual rearrangements.
    - Use the installed version of getx11font rather than that in the
      grandparent directory.
    - Always show the full panel rather than having multiple modes.
    - Remove bizarre "move down one boot menu option the first time a key is
      pressed" weirdness.
    - Use subtler boot menu selection colours in place of inverse-video.
    - Change the font to GNU unifont, from the unifont package.
    - Update language codes and names from localechooser 0.22ubuntu2.
    - Include /usr/share/gfxboot/themes/Ubuntu/bootlogo.tar.gz, which can be
      unpacked directly into /isolinux on a CD rather than having to unpack
      and repack cpio archives.
    - Avoid mentioning the distribution name in "insert boot disk" messages.
