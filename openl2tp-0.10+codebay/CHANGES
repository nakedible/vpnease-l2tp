This file is a history of changes made in each release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.10, 16-APR-2006

- Add support for 2.6 kernels to 2.6.16. Fix SMP issues in pppol2tp
  kernel module. Due to several changes in the 2.6 kernel, conditional
  compilation to handle specific kernel versions is required. Separate
  kernel patches provided for 2.6.8.1 thru 2.6.16.

- Improve kernel module builds for 2.6 kernels, making it much easier
  for common-case where the code is compiled and installed on the same
  Linux host. This will also make it much easier to produce binary
  packages.

- Handle hostnames longer than 32 chars. If hostnames are longer,
  openl2tpd would fail to start!

- Add MIPS architecture support (big and little endian).

- Fix rpcgen segfaults at compile time on some platforms. This turned
  out to be caused by the definition of SESSION_INCALL_IND API in the
  RPC protocol definition file which is not yet supported anyway,
  hence it was safe to redefine the API to avoid the rpcgen
  problem. Remove rpcgen sources from the distribution.

- Patch from Alvin Starr <alvin@iplink.net> for PPP multilink
  support. Includes new "multilink" parameter in ppp
  profile. Controlled by new CLI "multilink" parameter for ppp
  profiles.

- Minor tweaks to makefiles, allowing daemon and application to be built
  separately. This allows for configs where control app is not running
  on the same system as the daemon.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.9, 10-SEP-2005

Key changes are to fix build problems with newer distros. Also,
OpenL2TP now uses an official RPC program ID obtained from Sun
Microsystems. Major bugfixes for problems found during interopability
testing.

- Avoid use of Linux __u8, __u16, __u32 types, Use standard uintN_t
  types instead. This change is required because newer glibc header
  files warn when some newer Linux kernel headers are included by
  application code.

- Fix compile errors in newer distributions (Suse 9.1, FC2+, RHEL3)
  caused by including asm/byteorder.h instead or endian.h. For kernel
  module builds, let the compiler use include files from the standard
  compiler areas.

- Fix pppol2tp kernel driver module load problems. Change the
  ip_[gs]setsockopt() calls to use udp_prot.[gs]setsockopt() instead.

- Fix pppol2tp kernel driver "source route failed" errors which
  occurred at random in LNS configurations where data traffic was
  forwarded through the LNS rather than being locally terminated.

- Fix 2.6 kernel driver for 2.6.10 and later kernels. Core kernel PPP
  code has seen significant changes from 2.6.10 thru 2.6.12.

- Use ppp-2.4.3 by default.

- Change default PPP interface names from l2tp<tid>/<sid> to
  l2tp<tid>-<sid> where tid and sid are the L2TP tunnel id and session
  id. This change is needed because 2.6 kernels now prevent the '/'
  character being used in interface names.

- Change RPC interfaces to use the recently registered official RPC 
  program numbers rather than numbers in Sun's "experimental" range.
  Be sure to upgrade client (management) apps in sync with openl2tpd
  and ippoold (if used).

- Add PPC architecture support. Minimal changes needed in kernel
  module makefile. Support for MIPS is planned before 1.0.

- Add default_route parameter to PPP profile. This tells the system to
  make a PPP link of an L2TP session the default route. Add ppp
  profile default_route=yes|no command.

- Fix a bug where primary DNS server configuration in a PPP profile
  was setting the PPP WINS server address, not DNS server address.

- Patch from Cleber Rodrigues <cleber@sistemasabertos.com.br
  - Fix default pppd location to use relative path usr/sbin/pppd rather
    than absolute path.
  - Fix formatting of pppd spawn log text.

- Patch from Benjamin Sonntag <benjamin@sonntag.fr>:
  - Fix a bug writing the wrong pid into the pid file.
  - Add Debian package support.

- Fix several problems found by Hai Wang <hwang@finepoint.com>
  - Interopability, protocol and performance testing using 
    Ixia Ax4000 tester.
  - L2TP M-bit now correctly set in all messages.
  - BearerType and FramingType AVPs now correctly formatted.
  - BearerType and FramingType AVP values now follow configured
    settings
  - Include PPP address/control header in outgoing L2TP data packets.
  - Don't trap application failure aignals when compiled for debug

- Add an extra clause to LICENSE clarifying that users using OpenL2TP
  under its GPL license cannot change the advertised vendor string.

- Include rpcgen sources in a new rpcgen subdirectory to workaround
  problems with the rpcgen utility included in some newer
  distributions such as Fedora Linux where rpcgen segfaults when
  compiling OpenL2TP's protocol definition files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.8, 19-OCT-2004

- Fix several Makefile issues with the previous release, preventing 
  builds in some environments.

- Fix a bug with AVP hiding that was sometimes causing corrupt data to
  be sent/received.

- Fix persistent tunnels which were broken in V0.7. Tunnels would
  refuse to delete in certain circumstances.

- Add a new argument to the pppd plugin, pppol2tp_ifname, allowing the
  PPP interface to be named. Sessions can have an interface name
  specified using the interface_name= parameter of the session or
  session profile. If interface_name is unspecified, the pppN device
  will be named l2tp<tunnel_id>/<session_id>. Since ifconfig displays
  only 8 characters of interface names, it is recommended that the "ip
  link" command be used instead.

- Modify pppd plugin to workaround MTU negotiation problems with some
  third party PPP implementations. By default, Cisco advertise an MTU
  of 1500 unless configured otherwise. They were refusing our lower
  MTU value and we were accepting their MTU instead. Local interface
  MTU is now set properly.

- Modify pppd plugin to use sync-mode PPP by default. To obtain the
  same behavior as previous releases, set sync_mode=async in the 
  default PPP profile.

- Add Path MTU Discovery support (rfc1191). If a tunnel is created
  with the do_pmtu_discovery=yes option, packets are transmitted with
  the DontFragment bit set. The tunnel also self-learns changes to
  Path MTU along the tunnel path. Note, however, that it only reacts to
  reductions in Path MTU: increases to MTU are not detected. If you see
  problems when PMTU discovery is enabled, check that traceroute works
  between the tunnel endpoints. PMTU discovery relies on ICMP messages
  which are frequently filtered by misconfigured firewalls...

- Modify kernel pppol2tp driver to pass IP level socket options to
  the kernel's IP code when setsockopt() and getsockopt() are done on
  PPPoL2TP sockets.

- Modify kernel pppol2tp driver to insert a PPP header between L2TP
  header and user data of data packets. Although this seems to be
  optional, Cisco sends the header so we do too now.

- Modify default UDP checksum setting to ON as specified in rfc2661.
  To retain behavior of previous releases, set use_udp_checksums=off
  in the default tunnel profile.

- Add L2TP SLI message support. PPP watches LCP negotiation to catch
  negotiated asyncmap (accm) values. ACCM values are indicated to
  L2TP peers via the SLI control message. This change adds a new
  PPP_ACCM_IND RPC message which is used by PPP processes to indicate
  the ACCM values to L2TP.

- Add new arguments to pppd plugin to tell pppd of the session's L2TP
  tunnel_id and session_id. These are needed by pppd when sending
  PPP_ACCM_IND messages to OpenL2TP.

- Improve application RPC service registration to avoid "failure to
  register RPC" errors, causing openl2tpd to quit at startup.

- Create a pid file /var/run/openl2tpd.pid and prevent application
  startup if the file already exists, i.e. prevent multiple openl2tpd
  instances.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.7, 15-OCT-2004

NOTE: There are kernel and application API changes in this
release. Kernel module and applications must be updated together.

- Fix RPC requestor address check bug. This problem was first reported
  by Anil Gupta several weeks ago and caused l2tpconfig commands to
  randomly time out or in severe cases, to always time out. It turns
  out that OpenL2TP was testing a variable that hadn't yet been
  initialized by the RPC subsystem so it was just luck that anything
  ever worked!  This fix should mean it is no longer necessary to use
  -R when starting openl2tpd.

- Add data packet reordering support (kernel module changes). Tested
  against Cisco IOS using Linux netem. Data packets will only be
  reordered if the following session parameters are set:-
  - reorder_timeout (in milliseconds)
  - use_sequence_numbers (LNS) or sequencing_required (LAC)

- Fix a potential skb leak if a skb is queued to a full socket
  (congestion).

- Change data packet/byte/error stats to be uint64 rather than uint32
  since these counters can easily wrap. This change means that RPC
  client applications (e.g. l2tpconfig) must be rebuilt and
  reinstalled at the same time as openl2tpd. The kernel interface
  GL2TPSTATS ioctl also changes so the kernel driver must also be
  reinstalled.

- Add code in PPPoX kernel core to auto-load PPPoX modules when
  PPPoE or PPPoL2TP is first used. Add the following lines to
  modules.conf to enable this feature. CONFIG_KMOD must be defined
  for this to work and the PPPoL2TP kernel support must be built
  in the Linux kernel tree, patched with one of the patches from the
  kernel/patches/ directory.

  alias pppox-proto-0 pppoe
  alias pppox-proto-1 pppol2tp

- Add data packet out-of-sequence packets/discards counters.

- Improve RPC interface definition files by adding parameter names in
  interface definitions. This does not alter the interfaces - it just 
  improves readability of the l2tp*.x interface definition files.

- Set some file descriptors close-on-exec flag to ensure that they are not
  inherited by child processes. Changes tunnel/session event fds and
  timer fd. 

- Add UML build option for pppol2tp drivers.

- Fix a bug in the ppp_unix plugin in handling pppd startup
  problems. Each failure would leave a forked openl2tpd running. Also
  fix a bug not clearing the L2TP session if pppd fails to start up.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.6, 03-OCT-2004

NOTE: There is a kernel API change. Kernel driver and applications
must be updated together.

- Modify kernel struct sockaddr_pppol2tp to include the pid owner of
  the tunnel socket. Modify the kernel driver to reference the tunnel
  socket using the pid (if non-zero), thus allowing one process to
  open the tunnel socket (openl2tpd) and another to open session
  sockets (ppp). This change is needed when PPP sessions are handled
  by a separate process that is not forked by openl2tpd.

- Update openl2tp plugins for kernel interface change.

- Add l2tp_event RPC interface, giving external PPP processes an
  interface to tell of session up/down events. This interface is not
  needed if pppd is used (since it is openl2tpd that spawns pppd
  processes and it detects when such processes terminate). It is for
  use by other PPP implementations.

- Fix a kernel driver bug in handling an error condition which could
  have caused a kernel panic.

- Add a ppp_test plugin for testing session socket operations without
  spawning pppd processes. For testing only.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.5, 20-SEP-2004

- Update kernel driver with struct sockaddr_pppox changes. Comments from
  kernel mailing list suggested changing struct sockaddr_pppox (a union
  of pppoe/pppol2tp) to separate sockaddr structures because struct size
  was changed by the addition of pppol2tp, potentially breaking some
  pppoe binary apps already out there. If you use PPPoE, make sure you
  take this update.

- Change openl2tpd and its ppp_unix plugin to use the new sockaddr_pppol2tp
  type.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.4, 18-SEP-2004

- Fix a "peer use count goes negative" problem which could occur in
  one codepath if a tunnel setup failed. Could cause core dump in some
  circumstances.

- Fix some memory leaks in session contexts.

- Fix a bug not updating system tunnel_setup_failures count.

- Update application version number. Forgot to do so in 0.3.

- Add control packet reordering, implemented in openl2tpd. Packets are
  held for up to 1 second when trying to reorder. Kernel datapath
  reordering is still to come.

- Add an indicator in tunnel_show() to show whether a tunnel is
  secured by IPSEC for user convenience. Will only work with native
  linux-2.6 kernel IPSEC support.

- Add persistent tunnel support. New 'persist' parameter for
  tunnel_create() and tunnel_modify() may only be set on locally
  created tunnels. When such tunnel fails, system will attempt to
  recreate every 5 minutes (default). Any locally created session in a
  persistent tunnel will also be restored. Tunnel/session ids of
  restored tunnels/sessions will be different.

- Use private error codes (outside range of standard Unix codes) in
  management API to give user more info about errors. Some standard
  error codes may still occur, e.g. ENOMEM or socket errors, but
  general EINVAL, EEXIST, ENOENT etc should now not occur. All error
  codes are in the RPC interface definition file.

- Add new "debug" commands to l2tpconfig, making it easier to 
  manipulate the trace_flags parameter of system objects.

- Use a better hash algorithm in openl2tpd (from Linux 2.6 kernel).

- Internal changes to kernel driver to use Linux hashed lists rather
  than the previous home-grown methods. Cleaner code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.3, 13-SEP-2004

- Use hashed lists for tunnels and sessions to improve performance when
  there are lots of contexts.

- Fix several problems with setting explicit UDP port numbers in
  tunnel profiles or as parameters to "tunnel create". These problems
  were reported by Chris Andrews in the openl2tp mailing list.

- Add local IP address pool in pppol2tp pppd plugin, supported thru
  ippool. ippoold must be running and configured for IP pools to work.

- Use SIGTERM to kill pppd's rather than SIGKILL, giving pppd a chance
  to do cleanup before exit. The new ippool plugin for IP pool
  needs to be allowed to free any allocated addresses before pppd
  terminates, hence this change.

- Fix a bug in the kernel driver causing some packets to be
  transmitted directly to the tunnel peer (as plain IP packets) rather
  than through the PPP-over-L2TP session. This could be seen where ppp
  device receive data counters would not increase, or IPSEC
  configurations would not work because packets were being incorrectly
  routed.

- Fix a race condition in the kernel driver which could cause a kernel
  panic when doing stress testing with lots of sessions going up and
  down.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.2, 07-SEP-2004

- Fix openl2tpd and l2tpconfig -R command arg parsing bugs. Remote RPC
  was broken in V0.1!!

- Have syslog messages logged as "openl2tpd", not "l2tpd".

- Modify the vendor_name reported to the peer to include the Linux
  kernel version string and the CPU name. Also allow the vendor string
  to be overridden at build time for distros/OEMs. By default it's
  "Katalix Systems Ltd. Linux-<kernel_rev> (<cpu_name>)"

- Change l2tpconfig admin_name= parameters of tunnel and session
  commands to tunnel_name= and session_name= so that they're
  consistent with tunnel_id and session_id.

- Some internal cleanups, moving main_loop() into USL (User Space
  Library).

- Remove peer_addr and peer_port from peer profile list response data
  (changed interface definition file, l2tp_rpc.x), making the peer
  profile list consistent with the other profile lists in that they
  return only profile names.

- Modify l2tpconfig so that its list commands show output in sorted
  order. Previous version had the lists in order of creation and
  in some cases also depending on the state of the context (stupid).
  This change paves the way for hashed internal lists.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.1, 05-SEP-2004

- Initial release.
